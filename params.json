Specifically, CIRCOS uses circular visualization, allowing for a very easy-to-read presentation of your data.  \r\n\r\n### The Prokaryotic Genome\r\nIn single cell prokaryotes, hereditary information lies in the DNA or RNA nucleotides, thousands to millions of base pairs long. With such a large amount of information, it is often very difficult to process and interpret what is going on within your genome. With the SAMtoCIRCOS.py program, your information contained in a SAM file can be easily converted to the files required for CIRCOS visualization.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis program was designed at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Apprill Lab by Evan Denmark (@edenmark) and Matthew Neave (@neavemj) in 2014.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
